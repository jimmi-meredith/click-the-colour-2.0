# click-the-colour-2.0
Click the colour and not the word... easy right?

This is a side project I've been working on. it orginated as a basic project just to test some things using vanilla Javascript when I first started out. 
Since starting, I have chosen to build on it and turn it into a full-stack project since learning new technologies such as React and Redux.
This is an ongoing project I'm working on and will continue to develop new features for.
